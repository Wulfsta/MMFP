# MMFP
A Mathematica notebook that, given a list of verticies, solves 
for a rectilinear Steiner Tree. It uses the assumption that at 
least one vertex in the list is the root of two subtrees of 
the optimal Steiner Tree. This was hastily written for a final 
project in a Mathematical Modeling class and is most likely 
plagued by bugs and inefficient implementations.
